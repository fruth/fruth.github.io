Recently, I learned Angular.JS through eClasses. The best way to get more practice is to build something cool with it! Attached is a link to my new Angular project, which pulls asteroid data from the NASA Public Data API, and sorts through the ones that are potentially hazardous to humankind.

The source code for this project can be found in my GitHub repository for this website. You can link to it directly [here](https://github.com/fruth/fruth.github.io/tree/master/asteroids)!
