  <h1 class="page-heading">Howdy!</h1>

  <p>My name is Aaron Fruth, and I'm a web developer living currently in sunny New Mexico! I'm currently working in new web technologies such as Node.js, Angular.js, PHP, Laravel, SASS and LESS, and future web development frameworks.</p>
  
  <p>I enjoy building maps, photographing landscapes, and biking. Also, I reside with my boyfriend and a fluffy cat that is only interested in food!</p>
