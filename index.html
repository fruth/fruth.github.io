    <p>My name is Aaron Fruth, and I'm a web developer living currently in sunny New Mexico! I'm currently working in new web technologies such as Node.js, Angular.js, PHP, Laravel, SASS and LESS, and future web development frameworks.</p>
    
    <p>Besides programming, I enjoy the outdoors, photographing landscapes, and biking with my partner, our dog Lola, and our fluffy cat Raja that is only interested in food!</p>
